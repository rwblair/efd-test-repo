#### Task Instructions

##### Page 1: Setup

> Place your index finger on the comma key (,) and your middle finger on the period key (.). During this task, on each trial, you will see a letter presented, a short break, and then a second letter. For instance, you may see "A", which would then disappear to be replaced by "F".

##### Page 2: Rules

> Your task is to respond by pressing a button during the presentation of the second letter. If the first letter was an "A" AND the second letter is an "X", press your index finger. Otherwise, press your middle finger. We'll start with a practice round. During practice, you will receive feedback and a reminder of the rules. These will be taken out for the test, so make sure you understand the instructions before moving on. Remember, press your index finger after you see "A" followed by an "X", and your middle finger for all other combinations. Try to respond as quickly and accurately as possible.
